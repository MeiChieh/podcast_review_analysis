## Podcast Review Analysis

This is an analysis performed on the [Podcast Review Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/podcastreviews/versions/28/data).

Our goal is to perform EDA on the dataset to discover some interesting pattern within the data,
and run hypothesis testing to decide whether the observed pattern is statistically significant.
